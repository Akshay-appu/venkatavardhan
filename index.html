          <p>
            Dr. T. Venkat Vardhan is the Managing Director of India’s No.1 Events Company, DNA Entertainment Networks Private Limited which is headquartered in Bangalore. Born and educated between Kolar Gold Fields and Bangalore, a mechanical engineer from UVCE, he is responsible for single-handedly redefining and landscaping presentation of Mega Live Entertainment and Sports Events in India.

He leads a highly versatile, yet dedicated and dynamic team of professionals at DNA Networks who have collectively redefined events, logistics, production and promoting International Music, Sports and several unique corporate events.
His success mantra is to develop innovative ideas that bring value to the brand, not just through mass media & PR, but to actually implement customer interface. Despite changing landscapes in the industry, he has managed to keep DNA Networks abreast & ahead of all the challenges an events company could face. The intent was to provide an opportunity to develop and promote events on a large scale in India. Mr. Venkat was nominated as the President of Event Management Association of India for 3 years, under the aegis of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI). An avid sportsman, he has played Shuttle Badminton at the State & National levels. He was the State Champion of Karnataka in 1980. Presently he is a keen & avid golfer. He also serves as the President of the Golden Valley Education trust which imparts education to over 5000 students living in the rural district of Kolar, Karnataka. In February 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate for his contributions in the fields of Event Management & Live Entertainment by the University of Jerusalem. It can be said with confidence that he is the biggest draw in India in the field of events. He has over the last 2 decades played a colossal role in expanding the potential of the Indian market for International and domestic entertainment events, and has brought India on to the world map with innumerable high profile events such as the Brian Adams, Shaggy, Enrique, Sting, Dire Straits and many more. He is a pioneer in the field of Event Marketing and Production
Having put Bangalore on the world’s music map, Mr. Venkat began his journey in event management with the legendary concert Europe in 1988, which was the first of its kind in the late 80’s in India. It witnessed a record 60,000 fans at the concert. With economic liberalization in the 90s, Venkat with DNA proved his credentials with the sell- out Bryan Adams concert at the Brabourne Stadium in 1994, followed by Yanni at the Taj in 1997. This propelled him into the global league of concert organisers. Since then, DNA Networks has not just handled rock stars but also high profile VIPs like the Ex- President of the USA, Bill Clinton, the Prime Minister of India and Chief Ministers of various states.
Venkat as he is fondly called by his friends and associates, started his career in Advertising at an early age. His desire to carve a niche in promotions urged him to develop Event Management as his forte, a field that was relatively new in the 1980s. However, with his unending commitment he was able to evolve strategies and events that caught the attention of prominent clients in India like PepsiCo India, The UB Group, Britannia Industries Ltd, United Spirits- Diageo, Honeywell, HP, Bosch, Reliance Industries, Samsung, Thomson Reuters, Microland, AD Club, Milk Route, Louis Philippe, Manipal Hospitals, Canara Bank among others who engage the production and marketing services of DNA Networks.
The foray into ‘Sportainment’ propelled DNA Networks into a whole new field of event management services. As an avid sportsman, he played Shuttle Badminton at the University, State and National levels and was also the Karnataka State Champion in 1980. Also an avid golfer, the foray into managing sports events and entertainment in sports. The affiliation with sports goes back to more than a decade and it started with the Cricket World Cup Tour in ’99. He has ensured that we serve as the preferred partner of BCCI and various IPL franchises for their match entertainment needs over the years. He provides and ideates the unique mix of specialization in Events and live entertainment management while understanding the specific needs of sports. Extensive work across different tournaments for different clients has allowed Venkat and his team to provide services to the BCCI, ICC, IPL, ISL, PKL, HIL & IBL, making DNA Networks one of the most sought after event management company in South- East Asia.
